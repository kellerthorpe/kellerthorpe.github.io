  <dt class="category">Our dog, Sparky, likes to eat whatever the kids are snacking on. Is it OK for the dog to eat chocolate?</dt>
    <dd>Chocolate is toxic to dogs. Please do not feed your dog chocolate. Try
playing a game with your children &mdash; when you feed them people treats, they can
feed Sparky dog treats.</dd>

<dt class="category">If our pet is always indoors, do we need to worry about fleas?</dt>
    <dd>Unfortunately, indoor only animals can still be infested with fleas. Adult fleas, flea larvae and flea eggs can be carried into your home on inanimate objects, such as shoes, clothing or shopping bags. Once inside your home, a single flea can lay thousands of eggs that can take up residence in your carpets or on your beloved pets. If you’re ever faced with a flea infestation, keep in mind that their lifecycle lasts approximately 3 months, so it’s important to continue treating for a few months to make sure you eliminate them for good.</dd>
    
<dt class="category">Is it true that if my dog's nose is warm and dry he is sick?</dt>
    <dd>This is a very widely spread believe, but it’s also false. Both the temperature and humidity of a dog’s nose change frequently throughout the day, regardless of whether the dog is sick or not. These changes are usually related to environmental conditions: poor air circulation, room temperature, etc. You should always rely on abnormal clinical signs, such as not eating, lethargy or vomiting, as indicators of illness, rather that the state of your dog’s nose.</dd>
